# Pay-Caculator
To use the Pay Calculator, simply ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, unzip the file and open the "paycalculator.py" file.

This program calculates pay and overtime pay based on hours worked, applying overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours over 40. Additionally, it applies a 20 percent tax withholding to the total pay amount.
