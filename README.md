# Pay-Caculator
To use the Pay Calculator, simply ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, unzip the file and open the "paycalculator.py" file.

This program calculates pay and overtime pay based on hours worked, applying overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours over 40. Additionally, it applies a 20 percent tax withholding to the total pay amount. The program will now display the amount of taxes owed/paid. 

# Tax-Rate-Tool
The tax rate tool uses the 2024 tax brackets and the user's specified weekly earnings, to tell you your federal tax rate. PS. It just multiplies weekly earnings by 52 to get your yearly earnings so it doesn't account for a "light week", or any other variations in pay.
