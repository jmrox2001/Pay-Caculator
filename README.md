# Pay-Caculator
To use the Pay Calculator, simply ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, unzip the file and open the "paycalculator.py" file.

This program calculates pay and overtime pay based on hours worked, applying overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours over 40. 
Additionally, this program has logic for 2024 tax brackets, so it can calculate an estimate of taxes owed.
Disclaimer: This program is for educational and entertainment purposes only. I do not recommend using it for tax filings or any important accounting tasks.
